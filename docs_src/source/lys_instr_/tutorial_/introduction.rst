Introduction
============

*lys_instr* is a Python package that provides essential components for instrument control and automated measurements.

It includes modules for common components of measurement systems, such as motors, detectors, and data storage. 
Users can construct custom measurement processes by combining these modules. 
Both character user interface (CUI) and graphical user interface (GUI) tools are provided.

While *lys_instr* can be used independently for data acquisition, 
we recommend using it in conjunction with the *lys* package (https://github.com/lys-devel/lys), 
which provides comprehensive functionality for data analysis and visualization.

We recommend following the :doc:`Getting Started </tutorial>` guide to become familiar with this package and referring to the examples there for various use cases.
